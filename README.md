# datadog-metrics
> Buffered metrics reporting via the DataDog HTTP API.

Datadog-metrics lets you collect application metrics through DataDog's HTTP API. Using the HTTP API has the benefit that you **don't need to install the DataDog Agent (StatsD)**. Just get an API key, install the module and you're ready to go.

The downside of using the HTTP API is that it can negatively affect your app's performance. Datadog-metrics **solves this issue by buffering metrics locally and periodically flushing them** to DataDog.

## Installation

```sh
npm install datadog-metrics --save
```

## Example

![](header.png)

Save the following into a file named `example_app.js`:
```js
var metrics = require('datadog-metrics');
metrics.init({ host: 'myhost', prefix: 'myapp.' });

function collectMemoryStats() {
    var memUsage = process.memoryUsage();
    metrics.gauge('memory.rss', memUsage.rss);
    metrics.gauge('memory.heapTotal', memUsage.heapTotal);
    metrics.gauge('memory.heapUsed', memUsage.heapUsed);
};

setInterval(collectMemoryStats, 5000);
```

Run it:
```sh
DATADOG_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY DEBUG=metrics node example_app.js
```

## Tutorial

There's also a longer [tutorial](https://dbader.org/blog/monitoring-your-nodejs-app-with-datadog) that walks you through setting up a monitoring dashboard on DataDog using datadog-metrics.


## Usage

### DataDog API key

Make sure the `DATADOG_API_KEY` environment variable is set to your DataDog
API key. You can find the API key under [Integrations > APIs](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api). *You only need to provide the API key, not the APP key. However, you can provide an APP key if you want by setting the `DATADOG_APP_KEY` environment variable.*

### Module setup

There are three ways to use this module to instrument an application.
They differ in the level of control that they provide.

#### Use case #1: Just let me track some metrics already!

Just require datadog-metrics and you're ready to go. After that you can call
`gauge`, `increment` and `histogram` to start reporting metrics.

```js
var metrics = require('datadog-metrics');
metrics.gauge('mygauge', 42);
```

#### Use case #2: I want some control over this thing!

If you want more control you can configure the module with a call to `init`.
Make sure you call this before you use the `gauge`, `increment` and `histogram`
functions. See the documentation for `init` below to learn more.

```js
var metrics = require('datadog-metrics');
metrics.init({ host: 'myhost', prefix: 'myapp.' });
metrics.gauge('mygauge', 42);
```


#### Use case #3: Must. Control. Everything.

If you need even more control you can create one or more `BufferedMetricsLogger` instances and manage them yourself:

```js
var metrics = require('datadog-metrics');
var metricsLogger = new metrics.BufferedMetricsLogger({
    apiKey: 'TESTKEY',
    host: 'myhost',
    prefix: 'myapp.',
    flushIntervalSeconds: 15,
    defaultTags: ['env:staging', 'region:us-east-1']
});
metricsLogger.gauge('mygauge', 42);
```

## API

### Initialization

`metrics.init(options)`

Where `options` is an object and can contain the following:

* `host`: Sets the hostname reported with each metric. (optional)
    * Setting a hostname is useful when you're running the same application
      on multiple machines and you want to track them separately in DataDog.
* `prefix`: Sets a default prefix for all metrics. (optional)
    * Use this to namespace your metrics.
* `flushIntervalSeconds`: How often to send metrics to DataDog. (optional)
    * This defaults to 15 seconds. Set it to 0 to disable auto-flushing which
      means you must call `flush()` manually.
* `apiKey`: Sets the DataDog API key. (optional)
    * It's usually best to keep this in an environment variable.
      Datadog-metrics looks for the API key in `DATADOG_API_KEY` by default.
* `appKey`: Sets the DataDog APP key. (optional)
    * It's usually best to keep this in an environment variable.
      Datadog-metrics looks for the APP key in `DATADOG_APP_KEY` by default.
* `defaultTags`: Default tags used for all metric reporting. (optional)
    * Set tags that are common to all metrics.
* `agent`: custom https agent (optional)
* `apiHost`: Sets the hostname of the target API endpoint. (optional)
    * Defaults to `api.datadoghq.com`


Example:

```js
metrics.init({ host: 'myhost', prefix: 'myapp.' });
```


### Gauges

`metrics.gauge(key, value[, tags[, timestamp]])`

Record the current *value* of a metric. They most recent value in
a given flush interval will be recorded. Optionally, specify a set of
tags to associate with the metric. This should be used for sum values
such as total hard disk space, process uptime, total number of active
users, or number of rows in a database table. The optional timestamp
is in milliseconds since 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC, e.g. from `Date.now()`.

Example:

```js
metrics.gauge('test.mem_free', 23);
```

### Counters

`metrics.increment(key[, value[, tags[, timestamp]]])`

Increment the counter by the given *value* (or `1` by default). Optionally,
specify a list of *tags* to associate with the metric. This is useful for
counting things such as incrementing a counter each time a page is requested.
The optional timestamp is in milliseconds since 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC,
e.g. from `Date.now()`.

Example:

```js
metrics.increment('test.requests_served');
metrics.increment('test.awesomeness_factor', 10);
```

### Histograms

`metrics.histogram(key, value[, tags[, timestamp]])`

Sample a histogram value. Histograms will produce metrics that
describe the distribution of the recorded values, namely the minimum,
maximum, average, count and the 75th, 85th, 95th and 99th percentiles.
Optionally, specify a list of *tags* to associate with the metric.
The optional timestamp is in milliseconds since 1 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC,
e.g. from `Date.now()`.

Example:

```js
metrics.histogram('test.service_time', 0.248);
```

### Flushing

`metrics.flush([onSuccess[, onError]])`

Calling `flush` sends any buffered metrics to DataDog. Unless you set
`flushIntervalSeconds` to 0 it won't be necessary to call this function.

It can be useful to trigger a manual flush by calling if you want to
make sure pending metrics have been sent before you quit the application
process, for example.

## Logging

Datadog-metrics uses the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug)
library for logging at runtime. You can enable debug logging by setting
the `DEBUG` environment variable when you run your app.

Example:

```sh
DEBUG=metrics node app.js
```

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```
